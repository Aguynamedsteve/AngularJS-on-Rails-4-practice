##AngularJS on Rails 4

Made following the tutorial found here: http://coderberry.me/blog/2013/04/22/angularjs-on-rails-4-part-1/. The goal is to have a single-page application which allows the viewer to select a screencast link on the left and view it on the right. An example of this would be found at http://ember101.com.
